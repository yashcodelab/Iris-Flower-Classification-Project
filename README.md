# Iris-Flower-Classification-Project
* Overview:-

This project involves building a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The dataset used is the famous Iris dataset, which is widely used for testing classification algorithms.

* Dataset:-

1. The dataset contains 150 records with the following features:
2. Sepal Length (in cm)
3. Sepal Width (in cm)
4. Petal Length (in cm)
5. Petal Width (in cm)
6. Species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

* Model:-

The model is trained using the Logistic Regression algorithm, but you can experiment with other algorithms, such as K-nearest neighbors, Decision Trees, or Support Vector Machines.

* Results:-

The model achieves an accuracy of 97% on the test data. Detailed performance metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score are included in the notebook.
